release notes v. 0.8.7
**********************
substring.sh:
- added -d option which will preserve any document counts that may be present
  in source lists and reduced those document counts to maximally be equal to the
  frequency each n-gram
- added -f option to sort output lists in decending order of n-gram frequency
- added a check to make sure no n-grams are doubly imported during the prep
  stage
- added a checking stage where input lists are checked for the right format
  before being processed
- fixed a minor bugs that could result in premature exiting of the script under
  certain conditions

cutoff.sh:
- adjusted verbose behaviour to list the input files that will be processed
- adjusted naming of output files to prevent overwriting of existing files
  with identical names.

README.txt: adjusted to document new -d option in substring.sh

release notes v. 0.8.2
**********************
- adjusted test_data
- substring.sh: adjusted mktemp call to work with both GNU (coreutils) 7.4 and the BSD version included in MacOS



release notes v. 0.8.1
**********************

substring.sh
------------
- filtered and unfiltered input lists are now tested to make sure they contain consecutive n-sizes.
- the script now tests if unfiltered lists are supplied that contain n-grams that are larger than the maximum n-size of filtered lists +1 and complains if that is the case
- document counts and other digits AFTER the frequency are now retained in the output lists (they are simply copied over from the source lists untouched)

listconv.sh
-----------
adjusted NOT to place an empty document count digit (i.e.) at the end of each line when no real document count is present in the source list.



release notes v. 0.8
********************

The functionality of substrd.sh, core_substring.sh and prep_stage.sh has been integrated into a new script: substring.sh. Additionally, the entire code was looked over and re-written in many places. Specifically,
- processing now takes place in a secure temporary directory, thus minimising the danger of interference
- the passing of arguments was simplified, now all arguments must be passed overtly (version 0.7's automatic mode was removed).
- the number of negative frequencies is reduced in some cases by allowing the use of unfiltered lists of size n+1 when the largest filtered list containing n-grams is of size n.
- minor adjustments to the help functions of all scripts
- new examples and updated documentation in README.txt
